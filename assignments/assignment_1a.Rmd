## Q1: Why are you taking this course?

I am taking this course because I want to practice coding. Also, I had trouble creating loops and functions in past data courses, so I will also like to sharpen that skill.

## Q2: What is your data science background?
Before coming to Bren, I had no data science background. I had never written any code. I feel comfortable working with R Studio and troubleshooting code. For my internships over the summer, I only worked in R Studio and did a lot of data wrangling and statistical analyses.
