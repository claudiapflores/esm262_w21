### Function 

## Create a function for flood recurrence interval probability
# Function finds the probability in any given year that a flood of that magnitude will be equaled or exceeded 

# Y = years in records
# T = recurrence interval (note: not an independent input, but a dependent input)
# R = magnitude ranking

recurrence_interval_prob <- function(Y,R){
  # Body 
  T <- Y + 1
  Prob <- (1)/(T/R)
  # Error checking
  R = ifelse((R < 0), 
             return("Ranking must be a positive integer"), 
             R)
  # Output is the probability 
  risk <- case_when(
             Prob > 0.5 ~ "High",
             Prob == 0.5 ~ "Medium",
             Prob < 0.5 ~ "Low"
             )
  return(risk)
}

# Testing for Years in records = 41 and Magnitude Ranking = 1

recurrence_interval_prob(41,1)

##### Example
### Data Frame

## Create a data frame with four columns named: R, Maximum Annual Discharge m^3/s, Year, and Y 

ranks = data.frame(R = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10), # Ranking magnitude
                   maximum_annual_discharge_m3_s = c(507,453,343,323,300,299,275,260,100,50),
                   year = c(2010,1975,1990,2004,2013,2006,1993,1991,1996,1999),
                   Y = (10) # Years on record
                   )

## Create a data frame to put results from loop
results = as.data.frame(matrix
                          (nrow = length(ranks), # Number of rows
                            ncol= 1) # Number of columns
                          )

### Loop

## Run a loop through the ranks data frame created using the R and Y columns 
for (i in 1:nrow(ranks)) # For each value (i) in the rows under the rank column
  {
  results[i,1] = # Place the result for each value (i) in the results data frame in column 1
    recurrence_interval_prob( # Function
      Y=ranks$Y[i], # Use values in the ranks data frame column Y
      R=ranks$R[i] # Use values in the ranks data frame column R
              )
}

## Name your column where your probability results are to "Prob"
names(results)[1] <- "Prob"


### Case_when 

## Add a column for results of the probability risk and use case_when to determine what the probability risk is based on the parameters of Prob > 0.5 is high, Prob = 0.5 is medium, and Prob < 0.5 is low
results <- results %>% 
  mutate(Prob_Risk = # Name of new column
           case_when( # Print the following "" if certain conditions for Prob results are met
             results$Prob > 0.5 ~ "High",
             results$Prob == 0.5 ~ "Medium",
             results$Prob < 0.5 ~ "Low"
             )
         )

```

while loop
```{r}
### Function 

## Create a function for residence time of a water molecule in a reservoir 
# Function finds the time a water molecule spends in a reservoir 

# in_res = amount of gallons of water in reservoir 
# out = amount of gallons of water in reservoir that flow out per year

residence_time <- function(in_res,out){
  # Body 
  residence_time <- in_res/out
  # Error checking
  out = ifelse((out <= 0), 
               return("Is resevoir is a terminal lake?"), 
               out)
  # Output is residence time
  return(residence_time)
}


## Test function and error check
residence_time(100,0)

### While loop

## Set up initial conditions
storage <- c() # create an output/space for storage of results 
in_res = 100 # the amount inside the reservoir is 100 gallons
out = 1 # the initial amount of outflow (gallons/year) for the reservoir 
  
while((in_res > out) && (out < 20)) # conditions that need to be met initially or at some point for the loop to run) 
  {
  year <- residence_time(in_res, out) # function
  out <- 1 + out # keep adding 1 to the initial amount of outflow and then on until 20 is reached
  storage <- c(storage,year) # store results into this vector name
  
}

print(storage) # show results stored into the vector name
print(out) # show the final outflow value 
```
